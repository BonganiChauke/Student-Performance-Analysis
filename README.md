# Student Scores Analysis

This project analyzes student scores from a dataset, performing several operations such as calculating averages, identifying top performers, and visualizing data distributions. 

## Features
1. **Calculate the Mean Score**: Compute the average score of all students.
2. **Identify the Highest Score**: Find the highest score and the student who achieved it.
3. **Count Total Students**: Determine the number of unique students in the dataset.
4. **Group by Subject**: Calculate the mean score per subject.
5. **Visualize Data**: Display the score distribution using a histogram.
6. **Identify Underperformers**: List students scoring below average with suggestions for improvement.

## Instructions to Run the Notebook in VS Code

Follow these steps to set up and run the project in Visual Studio Code:
- Use Windows. Mac, or Linux to run the project

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python installed on your system. Download from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Install Visual Studio Code
- Download and install Visual Studio Code: [VS Code Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### 3. Install Required Extensions
- Open VS Code and navigate to the **Extensions** view by clicking the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
- Search for and install the following extensions:
  - **Python**: [Python Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
  - **Jupyter**: [Jupyter Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)

### 4. Install Dependencies
- Open a terminal in VS Code by pressing `Ctrl+`` (backtick).
- Install `pandas` and `matplotlib` using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas matplotlib
  ```

### 5. Clone the Repository
- Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

### 6. Open the Notebook
- Open the file student_scores_analysis.ipynb in VS Code.
- You can view the notebook in the Jupyter Notebook editor integrated into VS Code.

### 7. Run the Notebook

Follow these steps to execute the notebook in Visual Studio Code:

1. **Select the Python Interpreter**:
   - At the top right of the notebook editor in VS Code, click the kernel selection dropdown.
   - Choose the Python interpreter that has the required dependencies installed.

2. **Run Cells Sequentially**:
   - Each cell in the notebook represents a block of code or markdown.
   - Click the `Run` button (â–¶) next to a cell or press `Shift+Enter` to execute the cell.
   - Proceed sequentially from the top to ensure the notebook executes in the correct order.

3. **Inspect Outputs**:
   - Outputs, including printed values, tables, and plots, will appear directly below the code cells.
   - Review each output to verify that the calculations and visualizations are correct.

4. **Save Results**:
   - To preserve your work, save the notebook by pressing `Ctrl+S` or using the File menu.

If you encounter any issues with the notebook or its dependencies, revisit the previous setup steps to ensure all extensions and packages are correctly installed.


## Dataset
- Ensure the dataset (student_scores_statistics.csv) is in the same directory as the notebook or adjust the file path in the code.

## Sample Output
- The notebook provides the following outputs:
- Mean score of students.
- Details of the highest-scoring student.
- Total number of students.
- Mean scores for each subject.
- Histogram of score distribution.
- List of students scoring below average with improvement suggestions.
